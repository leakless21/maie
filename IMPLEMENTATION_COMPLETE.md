## 💡 Key Insights

### Design Philosophy

> Diarization is an **optional enhancement**, not core functionality.
> If it fails → skip gracefully, continue job, log what happened.
> Never break the main pipeline.

### Implementation Strategy

> **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** is the way to go:
>
> 1. Write tests first (with mocks)
> 2. Implement code to pass tests
> 3. Refactor while keeping tests green
>    This ensures quality from day one.

### Alignment Algorithm

> The IoU (Intersection over Union) approach is **simple, robust, and proven**:
>
> - Single speaker: trivial
> - Multiple speakers: split text (word-level if available, proportional fallback)
> - No speakers: mark None
>   No over-engineering needed.
