# Chat package removed â€” template manager no longer present.
# The project now relies solely on the default runtime chat template (e.g., vLLM's built-in template).
# This file is intentionally left as a lightweight placeholder so imports that target
# src.processors.chat.template_manager (if any remain) will still succeed.
#
# Do not add logic here; custom chat templates are deprecated and removed.
