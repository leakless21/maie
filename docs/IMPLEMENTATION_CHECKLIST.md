## Security Improvements Verified

- [x] DoS prevention via memory exhaustion - **FIXED**
- [x] Size validation during streaming - **IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] UUID-based filenames (path traversal prevention) - **MAINTAINED**
- [x] MIME type validation - **MAINTAINED**
- [x] File extension validation - **MAINTAINED**

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

- Chunk size is hard-coded (64KB)
- No progress tracking for uploads
- No checksum validation
- No resume support for interrupted uploads

### Recommended Future Enhancements

1. Make chunk size configurable via environment variable
2. Add progress callback support
3. Implement checksum validation during streaming
4. Add resumable upload support
5. Consider compression/decompression support
