#### **1. Vision & Problem Statement**

- **1.1. Vision:** To create a robust, self-hostable backend service that empowers developers to integrate reproducible, auditable, and advanced audio processing capabilities—including transcription, summarization, and categorization—into their applications through a well-documented and type-safe API.
- **1.2. Problem:** Developers lack an on-premises solution that can process raw audio into structured, intelligent documents while providing the necessary versioning and metrics to ensure results are trustworthy and reproducible over time.

#### **2. Core User & Use Case**

- **2.1. Primary User:** Application Developers (Frontend/Full-Stack).
- **2.2. User Story:** "As a developer building a data-sensitive application, I want to submit an audio file and receive a clean transcript, a structured summary, and relevant category tags, along with complete versioning and performance metadata, so that I can build a reliable and auditable user-facing experience."

#### **3. High-Level Objectives**

- **3.1. Objective 1 (Intelligence):** Deliver a stable V1.0 API capable of transcription (single Whisper-based backend), structured summarization, and automated content categorization. Text enhancement is supported but only used when necessary.
- **3.2. Objective 2 (Reproducibility):** Every result generated by the API must be fully traceable, containing detailed version information for every component of the processing pipeline.
- **3.3. Objective 3 (Developer Experience):** Provide a first-class developer experience through a clear OpenAPI 3.1 specification and comprehensive documentation.
- **3.4. Objective 4 (Performance):** Achieve a processing time of approximately 2-3 minutes for a standard 45-minute audio file on defined target hardware (single GPU with 16-24GB VRAM).
- **3.5. Objective 5 (Simplicity & Minimal Config):** Favor opinionated defaults with minimal configuration (approximately 5–6 environment variables). Avoid per-request overrides in V1.0.
- **3.6. Objective 6 (Simplicity):** Minimize deployment complexity through a streamlined architecture optimized for single-GPU environments with sequential model execution only (no preloading in V1.0).
- **3.7. Objective 7 (Production Readiness):** Long-context handling is deferred post V1.0. For V1.0, typical transcripts are processed directly within the model context window.
