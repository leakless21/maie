1. **DETAILED EXAMPLE (Lecture)**:
   - **Input Transcript**: "Today, we will learn about the Economic History of Vietnam during the Doi Moi period, starting from 1986. Before that, the centrally planned economy revealed many weaknesses, hyperinflation, and difficult living conditions for the people. The 6th Party Congress initiated the Doi Moi policy, shifting to a socialist-oriented market economy. The initial phase, from 1986-1990, was a period of overcoming difficulties and removing subsidies. The Foreign Investment Law of 1987 was introduced, opening the door to international capital. The next phase, 1991-2000, witnessed remarkable growth, Vietnam normalized relations with the US and joined ASEAN. Agriculture developed strongly, from a food-deficient country we became one of the leading rice exporters. However, the 1997 Asian financial crisis also caused significant impacts. From 2001 to present, the focus has been on deep integration, with joining the WTO in 2007 being a major milestone. The private sector is encouraged to develop and has become an important driver of the economy."
